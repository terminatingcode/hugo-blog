Recently, I've been challenged to think more about my pair programming style
and how I share the responsibilities of driving and navigating with my pair.
Inspired by Marlena Compton's post <a href="https://medium.com/@marlenac/pair-programming-taking-turns-with-your-pair-32fc344d62b9">different ways to pair.</a>

Using Jenn Schiffer's online <a href="https://make8bitart.com/">8-bit art maker</a>,
I quickly drew some icons to better represent the various techniques that she proposed to show to my team.

Feel free to use these images for educational purposes and to let me know via Twitter!


## Roles
<div class="flex-class">

{{% img src="images/driver-brunette.png" caption="Driver"%}}
{{% img src="images/navigator.png" caption="Navigator" %}}
{{% img src="images/navigator-blue.png" caption="Navigator"%}}
</div>
## Techniques
### Ping Pong
{{% img src="images/ping-pong.png" caption="Ping Pong"%}}
The classic Ping Pong technique where one person writes a failing test
and then the other tries to implement the minimum necessary code in order to pass the test.

This can also be implemented with non-TDD where one person writes an implementation
and the other tries to refactor it into something simpler.
### Switch on Tasks
<div class="flex-class">
{{% img src="images/tasks-blue.png" caption="Switch on Task"%}}
{{% img src="images/tasks-green.png" caption="Switch on Task"%}}
</div>
The pair decide on a set of tasks that need to be accomplished and switch after
each task is accomplished. If tasks take longer than anticipated, take breaks or switch who is typing.
### Pomodoro
<div class="flex-class">
{{% img src="images/pomodoro.png" caption="Pomodoro"%}}
{{% img src="images/pomodoro-25.png" caption="Pomodoro"%}}
The dependable study technique, Pomodoro is where a timer is used to signal the
switch between pairs and taking breaks. Typically this is 25 minutes of work + a 5 minute break.
</div>
### Pairmate
{{% img src="images/gopher.png" caption="Pairmate"%}}
A small item like a stuffed animal or tchotchke can be used to signal
who is navigating. The navigator holds the item to signal that they are not to touch
the keyboard until that item is passed off to the other.
### Switch on Google
{{% img src="images/search.png" caption="Switch on Google"%}}
Any time the thought pops into a pairâ€™s head that they would like to research
something further like a bug or documentation, the pair should switch to avoid
the temptation to research on the side.
